🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

We are the [Computational Optimization Methods Lab](https://comet.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST, led by [@chkwon.](https://github.com/chkwon)

We develop computational methods and tools for solving optimization problems, arising in transportation, logistics, mobility, service, production, etc.
